# 07_currencyConvertor_react
Currency Converter is a responsive web app made with Vite and React.js, and styled using Tailwind CSS. It helps users quickly convert money from one currency to another with an easy-to-use design. The app uses custom hooks that include React hooks like useState to keep track of data, useEffect to fetch currency information when needed, and useId to create unique IDs for inputs. These hooks make the code cleaner and easier to manage.
